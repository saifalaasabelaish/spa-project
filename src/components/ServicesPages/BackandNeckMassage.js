        title1="What is the back, neck and shoulders massage?" Paragraph1="Most spas offer their own take on this popular massage style, which targets the upper body and is loosely based around the technique used in Swedish massage.  At around 30 to 40 minutes, a back, neck and shoulders massage is a shorter treatment than a full body massage.  These are normally between 50 and 90 minutes and include arms, legs, hands and occasionally even your face, scalp and feet.
        The pressure used in a back, neck and shoulders massage may vary, although the therapist tends to use a light to medium touch, unless you request a deeper pressure. A good spa therapist will be willing to adapt a massage to suit your individual preference.  Variants of the classic back, neck and shoulder technique include the back, neck and scalp (or head) massage and the Chinese-based Daoyin Tao face, neck and shoulder massage treatment. Many facials also incorporate certain elements of a neck and shoulder and/or facial massage (usually performed while you have a face mask on). "
        title2="What happens during a back, neck and shoulders massage?" Paragraph2="In a back, neck and shoulders massage, sometimes the back, arms and legs are smoothed prior to the body massage using a ‘body brush’, rough mitt or exfoliating scrub to slough off dead skin cells on the skin surface and to stimulate lymph circulation to help the body’s natural detoxifying process.  Usually, your spa therapist will ask what type of pressure you like, then set to task on a stiff lower back, or loosening any muscular knots, commonly located between the shoulder blades and tops of the shoulders. This treatment also sometimes incorporates a soothing head massage, which, take it from us, is bliss! " 
        title3="What to expect after your treatment" Paragraph3="It’s best not to book in for dinner or a meeting immediately after your spa treatment. Find out why in our Handy tips – immediately after your massage section, which is packed with handy suggestions to help you get the most of out of your spa treatment!"
        title4="Did you know?" Paragraph4="Massage therapists are trained to never actually massage the vulnerable spinal cord itself when massaging the back, but rather to massage the muscles on either side. 
        A back, neck and shoulders massage can be purchased as part of a pamper day gift from our spa vouchers page. "/>
