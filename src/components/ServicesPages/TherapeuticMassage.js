        title1="What Is Therapeutic Massage?" Paragraph1="Therapeutic massage is a type of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) practice that is often used to treat muscle pain, injury, and stiffness. Massage therapy has also been used for the treatment of mental and emotional problems, including stress, anxiety, and depression.1

        Also considered a relaxation technique, massage therapy may be able to help reduce tension and elicit feelings of calm and deep relaxation. Additionally, massage may be able to curb feelings of fear and anxiety and assist in managing other panic disorder symptoms "
        title2="Types of Therapeutic Massage" Paragraph2="There are many different kinds of massage offered by massage therapists. Depending on the style, massages often vary in pressure and muscle group focus. Some of the most common types of massage include:Swedish massage: Swedish massage is the most popular type of massage therapy and is meant to help relax the body and mind. It involves a total body massage where a person lies on the massage table while the massage therapist slowly works through different muscle groups. Swedish massage also helps circulate blood flow, relieve mental stress, and reduce muscle pain and tension.
        Deep tissue: In deep tissue massage, the massage therapist uses more pressure and intensity when working through the muscles. The massage is aimed at releasing tense and painful muscle knots that are often associated with physical discomfort, stress, and headaches.3
        Sports massage: Often used by athletes, sports massage is used to assist in athletic training. This type of massage is focused on preparing muscles for intense training. Additionally, sports massage is used to help the muscles recover after intense performance or injury.
        Shiatsu: Frequently referred to as acupressure, Shiatsu is a form of massage that is similar to acupuncture. Shiatsu originated in Japan and means finger pressure.Instead of using needles like acupuncture, the practitioner uses their fingers on pressure points. Pushing these points is thought to help release energy and restore balance back to the body and mind." 
        title3="Techniques" Paragraph3="Massage therapy involves manipulating the muscles by kneading, rubbing, pressing, or patting different muscle groups. Some of the techniques used include:
        Effleurage: This involves light or deep strokes intended to help relieve tension and induce relaxation.
        Petrissage: This technique involves kneading muscles and can be helpful for relieving muscle tightness or spasms.
        Tapotement: This involves tapping or cupping the skin to create a percussion effect.
        Friction: In this technique, the massage therapist applies small, circular, focused pressure to specific points on the body.
        Massage therapists use their hands, forearms, and even elbows to work through various groups of muscles.4 Some massage therapists will also include aromatherapy oils and tranquil music to help create a peaceful and deeply relaxing experience."
        title4="What Therapeutic Massage Can Help With" Paragraph4="Therapeutic massage is often used to help relieve muscle tension and pain. It may be used on its own, but it is also often used in conjunction with other traditional pain treatments"/>
