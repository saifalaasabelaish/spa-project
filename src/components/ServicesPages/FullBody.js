        title1="Why Might Someone Opt For Full Body Hair Removal?" Paragraph1="Laser hair removal is a fairly new hair removal method. Although it is increasingly popular, still too few research has been conducted on many aspects of the procedure. That is why we advise pregnant women not to undergo laser treatments.

        Medication or hormone treatments can also okay a role. Indeed, some medication increase photosensitivity. Thus, the treatment may be more painful. Patients on antibiotics should wait at least two weeks after the end of their treatment before they come in for a laser session.
        
        If you are taking Roaccutane, you should wait at least six months. Hormone-based contraceptive and hormonal therapy may also interfere with the treatment. Indeed, the hair growth cycle is triggered by hormones. Thus, patients may need additional sessions.

        Results varies on several factors. Hormone levels, hair growth cycle, past hair removal history, skin colors, hair color, genetics, all play a role. Some patients will only need six sessions on non-hormonal areas. Other will need more.
