        title1="Hands Laser Hair Removal" Paragraph1=" 
        Are you sick of hair growing on the back of your hands or your knuckles? If so, laser hair removal from the hands might be for you!
        The hands aren’t the first body part that comes to mind when we think about laser hair removal, but the reality is that it’s a great treatment 
        for almost every kind of unwanted hair. It’s fast, convenient, and it gives long-term results, so what’s there not to like?
        If you’re curious about laser hair removal from your hands, here’s everything you need to know about this service."
        title2="How Laser Hair Removal From Hands Works" Paragraph2="Laser hair removal is a highly effective option for eliminating hair from the hands. 
        The laser works by zapping the hair follicle with light. Because it’s attracted to the pigment in the follicle,
         it doesn’t damage the skin around it.The damage from the laser inhibits the follicle’s ability to regrow hair, which is why it’s such an excellent long-term solution." 
        title3="How Many Sessions Will I Need?" Paragraph3="We always recommend clients start with 6 sessions, with appointments spaced 4-8 weeks apart. After that first series of sessions, you can evaluate whether you like your results or if you’d like to complete another series.
        It’s hard to predict exactly how many sessions each person will require. Hair growth cycles are impacted by a lot of individual factors. For instance, only the follicles that are in their growth stage will be impacted by the laser. Since only some of your hairs are in this 
        phase at the same time, we have to go over the same area again and again over the course of a few months in order to permanently reduce hair growth all over the hands."
        title4="Why Laser Hair Removal is the Best for Hands" Paragraph4="Laser hair removal hits on a magic trifecta that makes it the best hair removal solution for many: it’s long-lasting, it’s fast, and it’s cost-effective. The same can’t be said for any of the other hair removal methods out there.

        The only other hair removal method that gives lasting results is electrolysis, but it’s incredibly painful, slow, and expensive.
        
        Shaving and waxing don’t last. If you go the professional route for waxing, a single session is only a touch less expensive than a laser appointment. The difference is that with laser, you’ll only need 6-12 sessions, while with waxing you’ll have to keep going for the rest of your life.
